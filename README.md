##  Project Overview

This project is a **web-based interactive dashboard** that predicts loan approvals using a machine learning model and provides **explanations for each decision**. Users input their financial details—income, credit score, loan amount, and age—and the system returns:

- **Approval or Rejection** prediction  
- **Probability score** of approval  
- **Feature importance visualizations** showing which factors influenced the decision

This dashboard makes AI predictions **transparent, interpretable, and actionable**, ideal for financial institutions and end-users.
